        <h3 id="brief-definition-">Brief definition:</h3>
        <p>Kantianism is the deontological philosophy of
            Immanuel Kant. It is about the duty rather than emotions or end goals. The moral value of actions is based
            on their underlying principle. Kant&#39;s ethics are founded on his view of rationality as the ultimate good
            and his belief that all people are fundamentally rational beings. This led to the formulation of the
            categorical
            imperative, which is the criterion for whether a maxim is good or bad.</p>
        <h3 id="categorical-imperative">Categorical Imperative</h3>
        <p>Categorical imperatives are rules that are absolute or unconditional, because they are independent of any of
            these contingent considerations that concern practical matters with regards to how, in fact, we do and can,
            live our lives and make everyday decisions, but which do not reflect what we should morally do. As
            unconditional imperatives, they follow as a matter of necessity from Reason, can be known a priori (prior to
            experience) and apply with absolute necessity to all rational beings no matter what.</p>
        <p>The Categorical Imperative is one that represents &quot;an action as objectively necessary in itself apart
            from its relation to a further end&quot;.</p>
        <p>Or put more simply: it is a moral imperative that springs from Reason.</p>
        <h4 id="1-st-formulation">1st formulation</h4>
        <p>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal
            law.</p>
        <h4 id="2-nd-formulation">2nd formulation</h4>
        <p>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never
            merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.</p>
        <h4 id="3-rd-formulation">3rd formulation</h4>
        <p>Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were, through his maxim, always a legislating member in
            the universal kingdom of ends.</p>
