        <h3 id="brief-definition-">Brief definition:</h3>
        <p>Utilitarianism is a teleological and hedonic theory of morality, which advocates actions that foster
            happiness and oppose actions that cause unhappiness. Utilitarianism promotes &quot;the greatest amount of
            good for the greatest number of people&quot;. Before evaluating the consequences of an actions we must be
            morally neutral.</p>
        <h3 id="utilitarianism-s-basic-principle-of-utility-">Utilitarianism&#39;s basic principle of utility:</h3>
        <p>The principle of utility states that actions or behaviors are right as long as they result in pleasure, wrong
            as they produce pain or minimize pleasure. Therefore, utility is a teleological principle. Utilitarians
            believe that pleasure and pain can be quantified.</p>
        <h3 id="equal-consideration">Equal Consideration</h3>
        <p>Since the greatest amount of pleasure includes any being that has the capacity to experience pleasure and
            pain, any being that can be affected by our actions. Such beings are called sentient beings. Equal
            consideration refers to the view that all sentient beings hold the same value.</p>
        <h3 id="four-theses-of-utilitarianism-">Four Theses of Utilitarianism:</h3>
        <p>1. Consequentialism. The principle holds that the rightness of actions is determined solely by their
            consequences. It is by virtue of this thesis that utilitarianism is a teleological theory.</p>
        <p>2. Hedonism. Utility in this statement of the theory is identified with pleasure and the absence of pain.
            Hedonism is the thesis that pleasure and only pleasure is ultimately good.</p>
        <p>3. Maximalism. A right action is one that has not merely some good consequences but also the greatest number
            of good consequences possible when the bad consequences are also taken into consideration.</p>
        <p>4. Universalism. The consequences to be considered are those of everyone.</p>
        <h3 id="the-greatest-happiness-principle">The Greatest Happiness Principle</h3>
        <p>1) <em>&quot;</em>Everyone should perform that act or follow that moral rule that will bring about the
            greatest good for everyone concerned<em>&quot;.</em></p>
        <p>2) An act is right if it maximizes happiness, and/or it minimizes unhappiness for the majority of the people
            concerned with that act.</p>
        <h3 id="two-types-of-utilitarianism">Two types of Utilitarianism</h3>
        <h4 id="act-utilitarianism-">Act-Utilitarianism:</h4>
        <p>It determines rightness or wrongness of a single action solely on the basis of the principle of utility.</p>
        <h4 id="rule-utilitarianism-">Rule-Utilitarianism:</h4>
        <p>It suggests that we should establish and follow those rules that will maximize overall happiness for the
            greatest number of people in the long term.</p>
        <h3 id="the-utilitarian-method-of-ethical-reasoning">The Utilitarian method of ethical reasoning</h3>
        <p>1) State the action to be evaluated.</p>
        <p>2) Identify all those who are directly and indirectly affected by it.</p>
        <p>3) Specify all the good and bad consequences of the action for all those directly affected -- as far into the
            future as seems appropriate -- and imaginatively consider various possible outcomes and the likelihood of
            their occurrence.</p>
        <p>4) Weigh the total good results against the total bad results, considering such matters as the quantity and
            duration of the harms and benefits involved.</p>
        <p>5) Carry out a similar analysis, if necessary, for those indirectly affected, and for society as a whole.</p>
        <p>6) Sum up all the good and bad consequences. If the action produces more good than bad, the action is morally
            right; if it produces more bad than good, it is morally wrong.</p>
        <p>7) Consider, imaginatively, whether there are various alternatives other than simply the action and carry out
            a similar analysis for each of the other alternate actions.</p>
        <p>8) Compare the results of the various actions. The action that produces the <em>most good</em> (or the least
            bad) among those available is the morally proper thing to do.</p>
